### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer (previously for a couple of years a Cloud Engineer).

As a Software Engineer, I work with different technologies. I have to say that I am always learning, so I would say that I am a generalist and avid learner, mainly on technologies like Java, Python, Javascript, Ruby, Spring, Rails, React, Amplify, AWS, etc.

During my journey as a Cloud Engineer, I got five AWS certifications; the last two certs are Solutions Architect - Professional and Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional.

- 👨🏽‍💻 I'm currently working on serverless side project
- 📚 I'm presently learning React, AWS Amplify and Appsync
- 💬 Ask me about AWS or any programming topic (it is possible that I won't know, shoot)
- 📫 How to reach me: on [@jcastaneyra](https://twitter.com/jcastaneyra)
- ⌨️ Fun fact: I like mechanical keyboards, but don't have enough budget to buy more keyboards; on the other side, how many keyboards would you use along the day?
